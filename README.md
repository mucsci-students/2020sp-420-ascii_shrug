¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ UML Editor Help ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Commands:
add <classname> [options]     : adds classname to the diagram
remove <classname>  [options] : removes classname from the diagram
save <filename>.json          : save the diagram in a specified json file
load <filename>.json          : load the diagram stored in specified json file
print                         : prints the current diagram
exit                          : exit the editor (no warning for unsaved diagram)

Options:

"-a" [ID]                     : will add all ID as attributes of classname
"-r" [ID]                     : will create relationships from classname to all ID``

GUI
-To add a class, click add and supply a valid name.
-To remove a class, click remove and supply a valid name of a class in the diagram.
-To edit a class, click edit, supply a name. Then provide the attributes to add and the 
 attributes to remove.
-To save a diagram, click save and enter a file name.
-To load a diagram, click load and enter a file name.

#### Quirks:
- Able to modify attributes in GUI, they will not display.
- Relationships made by hovering and dragging from one class to another
  will not modify the model. 
- Classes can be double clicked to change the representation. The mode is
  not changed.
